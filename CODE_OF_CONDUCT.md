# Meetup Code of Conduct

_Adapted from https://confcodeofconduct.com/_
All participants in our meetup events regardless of involvement are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for every individual.

## Need Help?
Please contact the meetup organizers. You can also reach out to us on [hangops Slack](https://signup.hangops.com/)(#atxdevops is the unofficial chatroom home of the Austin Devops and Cloud Austin meetups and you can ask for direct contact info there), or approach any of us in person. We pledge to take any concerns seriously and follow up swiftly.

## The Quick Version
Our events are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any related venue, including talks, workshops, parties, and online media where we continue our discussions. Community members violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from an event and/or future events without remuneration (if money is involved) at the discretion of the organizers.

## The Less Quick Version
Harassment includes (but is not limited to) offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices. It includes the posting of sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior by anyone, not just the event organizers, are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. If there are booths at an event, booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate.  A few examples of these actions are: warning the offender, expulsion from the event, expulsion from future events with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer immediately. You may directly address the situation, as well, if you feel comfortable doing so, but we are here to address any and all situations falling under this code of conduct.

Organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all meetup events and during related activities.
