# Speakers FAQ

## What level is your audience? What's the audience like?

Our audience skews toward intermediate or advanced folks focused on development, operations, security, testing, and project management. We do love having new folks, though! Also, 101-type talks go over well because no one can be a specialist in everything. If you have concerns that your talk idea might not fit, feel free to reach out to us via email or hangops Slack to run the idea past us. We'll help you get on the right track.

## Can I do a vendor pitch?

No, we don't accept vendor pitches. If we accept a talk and it turns into a vendor pitch, we will tell you that was not a good idea and scrutinize any talks you or anyone from your company submit in the future. You likely will also find increased scrutiny if you attempt to submit to local conferences, too. Word gets around.

## What is a vendor pitch?

A vendor pitch is a talk that's focused on a specific product, specifically one that you work on or work for the parent company, as if you are invested in the product's success. Examples include how to solve a problem with X product (where you happen to work), how X product makes lives better, 

Ways to talk about a product without sounding like a vendor pitch include talking about the concepts behind the product (e.g., talking about Ci/CD pipelines if you work at CloudBees on Jenkins), talking about a known problem and reviewing the solutions, including your product, in an unbiased way, or even talking about how your company solved a common problem (or an uncommon one) *without* expressly calling out your product. Trust us: If people are looking for a solution like yours and they hear about the company in general, they will go look your product up. No need to hit them over the head with an obvious reference.

## How do I submit a talk?

Reach out to us (the organizers) via email or hangops Slack. Give us a rough title and an abstract, along with anything else you think we need to know like availability or if you are a new speaker. We'll put you in the pipeline and figure out where to go from there with you.

## Can someone give me some mentorship on a great talk for this group?

We can try to schedule something with you if all of our schedules work out. Reach out to us via email or hangops Slack, and we can start a conversation.
