# Sponsorship Notes and FAQ

While food/drink sponsorships are welcome and highly appreciated by our members, please understand that content rules this Meetup. Generally, you will get more visibility by contributing solid content to the Meetup along with any sponsorship your company wants to provide.

## What should I order?

We ask that, no matter what you order, you consider that some people attending may have food allergies and/or may be vegan or vegetarian. As long as you provide a good mixture of options for everyone in a good faith effort, you should be okay. The organizers are happy to help steer you if you're not sure what a good faith effort has looked like; please email us or find us on hangops Slack for more information.

Since this is Austin, barbecue or tacos always go over well and can be cost effective. Here are some local options that have gone over well in the past (note that you're asking for delivery or "drop-off catering" unless you have employees in the area who are willing to pick up the order and bring it with them to the Meetup):

* Austin Pizza
* Rudy's BBQ
* Torchy's Tacos

We will continue to update this list as we find more local vendors that do a fantastic job. 

## Do I get a chance to say anything about the company?

Absolutely! We give you roughly 5 minutes at the beginning of the Meetup after everyone is settled to talk. Remember the audience is generally filled with individual contributors, managers, and some directors. We recommend you keep any pitch light and informal; that kind of pitch goes over better than a full one. If you're actually sponsoring because you want to hire, fantastic! You'll get to pitch your company AND get to say that you're hiring during our starting "who's hunting/who's hiring" segment. Win/win.

## Can I get a guaranteed slot for one of my employees to pitch our product as a talk if we sponsor?

Unfortunately, this is not that kind of a Meetup. We love having anyone come give a technical talk on any topic, but product pitch talks fall flat here. At best, you'll get a polite but disengaged audience. At worst, you'll get people walking out. If that's the kind of thing you're thinking about, though, perhaps we can help you find a local conference that might be a better fit.

On the other hand, if one of your employees submits a talk and is accepted and you would like to sponsor the Meetup day they'll be speaking, that's fantastic! You'll get the same 5-minute window as other sponsors, and your speaker can get some warm-and-fuzzies that their company is supporting them.
